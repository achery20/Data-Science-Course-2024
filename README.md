# Data-Science-Course-2024
This repository contains my final group project for the data science course I took in spring 2024.
# Project Description:
Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews: This project involved analyzing Amazon product reviews to gain actionable insights for businesses and consumers.

# Key Highlights & Technical Skills
End-to-End Data Pipeline: Utilized Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Rainforest API to gather over 500 reviews. Cleaned and preprocessed the raw text data using NLTK, spaCy, and regular expressions to prepare it for analysis.

# Data Analysis & Visualization: 
Analyzed review sentiment and created visualizations with Matplotlib and the WordCloud library, including a word cloud, a rating distribution chart, and a sentiment polarity analysis with TextBlob.
